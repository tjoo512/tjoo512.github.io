                <p>
                    I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/">Department of Industrial Engineering & Management Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a>, where I am fortunate to work with <a href="https://dynresmanagement.com/index.html">Diego Klabjan</a>.

                    My research focuses on robust machine learning, aiming to maintain remarkable generalization performance of machine learning models in unpredictable environments while ensuring efficiency for real-world applications.
                    With expertise in statistics and optimization, I investigate how machine learning models can generalize to new tasks and adapt to unseen environments. My work also focuses on efficiently quantifying uncertainty to enable reliable decision-making, even under distribution shifts.

                <p>
                    Currently, I am exploring the opportunities and challenges of foundation models, with a focus on robustness, AI alignment and safety, and the interactions between these factors.

                    Previously, I was a senior deep learning researcher at ESTsoft, where I mostly worked on distribution shifts, contextual bandit, scalable variational inference, and model compression for machine learning in finance. I built the company's first ML model, which had been successfully operated in the Korean stock market.

                    <strong>Taejong Joo, Diego Klabjan</strong><br>
                    <em>Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)</em>, 2024

                    <p>
                        &thinsp; We prove that selectively promoting temporal consistency for confident predictions significantly enhances self-training performance under distribution shifts. This approach prevents the common issue of model collapse—where performance deteriorates after a few epochs of self-training—resulting in improved performances with attractive robustness properties.

                    <strong>Taejong Joo, Diego Klabjan</strong><br>
                    <em>International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)</em>, 2024

                    <p>
                        &thinsp; We introduce a new approach for simultaneously addressing model calibration and model selection in unsupervised domain adaptation: estimating the average accuracy across subpopulations. For efficient and accurate subpopulation accuracy estimation, we formulate the high-dimensional importance weight estimation problem into a more tractable coordinate-wise convex optimization problem.

                    <p>
			            &thinsp; We propose a scalable variational inference framework using a last-layer Dirichlet model as a new alternative to Bayesian neural networks. Our approach significantly enhances uncertainty representation ability of deterministic neural networks while preserving their strong generalization performances and efficiency unlike Monte Carlo dropout and deep ensembles.

                Guided by first principles and the elegance of Occam’s razor, I believe simplicity often reveals the deepest insights and leads to effective and versatile solutions (with far fewer headaches).

                Outside of work, I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen as a self-proclaimed master chef (enthusiastically endorsed by my wife), playing tennis, splashing paint on canvas, and traveling.
